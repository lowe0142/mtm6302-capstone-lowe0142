REPORT: My first instict with designing the "Astronomy Image of The Day" mockup was to incorporate colors that remind me of space. I started by incorporatign a black background to represent the dark galaxy, as well as adding white and gold font and buttons for the stars. Additionally, I ecided to chose the 'SquareFont' as my main font font for the title as it is quite similar to Sci-Fi film designs such as Star Wars and Star Trek both  heavily influencing the design of my website. I decided to incorporate a moon into the background of the page as well to give the users reference to what they will be viewing on the astronomy website. Finally, I added the NASA logo in black in white as it was cohesive with my mockup design theme, as well as it represents the API system we will be using to locate the images.
