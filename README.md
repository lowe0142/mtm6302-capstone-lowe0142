REPORT: My first instict for designing the "Astronomy Image of The Day" mockup was to incorporate colors that remind me of space. I started by incorporating a black background to represent the dark galaxy, as well as adding white and gold fonts as well as  buttons to represent the stars. Additionally, I decided to chose the 'SquareFont' as my main font font for the title as it is quite similar to Sci-Fi film designs such as Star Wars and Star Trek which both heavily influenced the design of my website. I decided to additionally add a moon into the background of the page as well to give the users reference to what they will be viewing on the astronomy image of the day page. Finally, I added the NASA logo in black in white as it was cohesive with my mockup design theme, as well as it represents the API system we will be using to locate the images. User will also be able to favourite the astronomy images by clickign the star located on the page.
